# Staph_aureus_viewer
A NYGC Hackathon Project to Create a JBrowse Viewer for Staph aureus genomes

The aim of this project is to develop a genome browser for Staphylococcus aureus genomes. NCBI genome database currently lists genome sequence data from 7968 stains, with varying degree of sequence completion. 165 strains have near-complete whole-genome sequence, while a majority of sequences exist as either scaffolds (
